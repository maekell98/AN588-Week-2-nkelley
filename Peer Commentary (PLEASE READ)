Hello all, this file is a simple way to survey how the rest of you would like to perform the peer review. There are two options, as Prof. Schmitt outlined on the website.

1. We each peer review one submission in a cycle of sorts. For example: I (Kenny) would review Natalia's, Natalia would review Isabel's, and so on.
2. We peer review each submission other than our own as a group. This I think would be the most comprehensive and thorough way to do it, but would also require the most coordination/might be a bit more annoying to do.

I will leave a line for each option below, and you guys can vote (by leaving a "/" next to the option you want to vote for) to decide which method we will choose.
I am now realizing that each of us will be making our own repository for the assignment, but because I believe everyone in the group will be able to see and edit this, I will leave it here.

Option 1: /
Option 2:
